### P2: Vehicle Availability

The goal of this assignment was to modify the Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization's regional travel demand model (TDM23) for vehicle availability, which used data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey, and compare the model performance and fit between the original model vs. my modified model.

### P3: Trip Generation

The goal of this assignment was to model a specific trip purpose from the TDM23 trip generation model and identify the strongest contributing factors. I chose to focus on examining the contributing factors to predicting whether a person will take a healthcare trip (medical, dental, therapy). 

### P4: Trip Distribution

The goal of this assignment was to calibrate a gravity model for home-based work trips across industries (goods, trade, service, and total jobs) using the LEHD data for a metropolitan or micropolitan area of my choice (I chose the micropolitan area Salem, Ohio).

### P5: Mode Choice

The goal of this assignment was to use 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data to predict whether adults (18-65) living in urban areas are more likely to walk for short trips (< 1.5mi) to run errands compared to adults (18-65) living in rural areas.
